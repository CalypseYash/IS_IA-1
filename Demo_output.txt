Filename:     demo.pcapng
No of frames: 3555
Start time:   Feb 23, 2023 00:26:17.068073000 India Standard Time

Capture Quality
---------------

Packets missed:       0
Duplicate packets:    0
Duplicates max delta: 0.0

Duplicate packet counts are based on TCP only, and so the actual
number of duplicate packets may be higher than shown here.

Route Stability
---------------

This table shows the level of variation in TTL value along a route.
A value of zero means no change was detected.  The higher the std
value, the greater the level of variance.

NB: The Route Stability assessment is only valid for the portion of the
route from the source IP to the point where the packets were captured.


Packet Loss
-----------

Excessive TCP Retransmissions

Typically, we are interested in TCP retransmissions and Dup ACKs for each
TCP connection, but here we are using this information as an indication of
packet loss.  For that reason, we aggregate these numbers for all TCP traffic
between IP address pairs.

* No TCP retransmissions seen

Excessive DUP ACKs
